# Say hello to MDaemon

## Description

This is a really basic example to use `node-mdaemon-api`.

It checks if MDaemon 23.5.x is present and whether the APIs are
compatible. If so, it shows a simple menu like the following:

    1. MDaemon Version
    2. MDaemon Modules
    3. Module Version
    4. Domains
    5. Users
    6. User Groups
    7. Mailing Lists
    8. Cluster Status
    9. Quit

## Installation

After cloning this repository, install its dependencies:

    yarn install

## How to start it

There are three ways to start this tiny example:

1. `yarn start`
2. `node index`
3. `node index.js`
